# Online Resume Project

Created as a project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program by yours truly, Macy McGahee.


## Information / Details / Background

Throughout the JavaScript Foundations course I built this resume project by writing JavaScript that effectively combines my personal information with some provided, pre-written HTML and CSS templates. I learned basic JavaScript syntax such as how to manipulate data, build loops and create functions. I also learned a few jQuery DOM manipulation methods.


## Usage

Download and unzip the folder, online-resume-project. Open the index.html file and your browser and enjoy.  


## Contributing

Feel free to do what you please with this project. You customize it to make it your own online resume!
